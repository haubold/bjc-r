<p>In der Timing-Versuchen der vorherigen Sektion hast du vielleicht bemerkt,
dass Computer immer ungefähr die gleiche Zeit benötigen, um eine Zahl zu erhöhen,
auch wenn diese immer höher wird. Informatiker nennen dies darum eine <strong>Konstantzeit</strong>-Operation.
Alle einfachen arithmetischen Operationen (Addition, Subtraktion, Multiplikation, Divison und Potenz) sind in der
Regel Konstantzeit-Operationen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that we call these operations <em>constant-time</em>
operations, but we don't actually say how much time they take.&nbsp;
Different computers will take different amounts of time to perform the
same operation.&nbsp; To report the exact time of any algorithm, we
would have to also report the physical configurations of the computer
that the algorithm was run on.&nbsp; This gets very difficult and
annoying very fast, especially with the almost infinite variety of
computers available today.&nbsp; Instead, we focus on how the running
time of an algorithm scales as we scale its inputs to larger and larger
sizes, because this is a property of the algorithm itself, and is
independent of the computer that it is run on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the computer take approximately the
same amount of time to increment a number, even though that number was
getting larger?&nbsp; Think about how you would add one to a number,
back from your elementary school days; this is similar to how a
computer does its arithmetic (ignoring technical details).&nbsp; The
elementary school way of adding numbers goes digit by digit, and so the
amount of time it takes for you to add two numbers depends on how many
digits each number has.&nbsp; As we doubled the number we were
incrementing, we didn't consistently add digits to it, and so the
computer took approximately the same time.&nbsp; Even as we began
scaling the number by ten, the computer (and you!) takes a relatively
small amount of time to account for the extra digit, so the
total time remains approximately constant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant-time operations are the Holy Grail
of computer science algorithms, and unfortunately, most algorithms are <em>not</em> constant-time, as we will soon see.</p>   </body></html>
